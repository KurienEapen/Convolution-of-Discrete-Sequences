# Convolution of Discrete Sequences
C program to perform convolution of two discrete sequences 

## Code Breakdown 

### Header 
```c
#include<stdio.h>
```
Basically _#include_ directive tells the preprocessor to insert the contents of another file (in this case stdio.h) into the source code at the point where the #include directive is found.

The C programming language provides many standard library functions for file input and output such as printf (to print something on the screen), scanf (to take inputs from keyboard), etc. These functions make up the bulk of the C standard library header <stdio.h>.

### Main Function
```c
main()
{
...
...
...
}
```
All C language programs must have a main() function. It’s the core of every program. It’s required. The main() function doesn’t really have to do anything other than be present inside your C source code. Eventually, it contains instructions that tell the computer to carry out whatever task your program is designed to do. But it’s not officially required to do anything.

### Variables 
```c
float x[15],h[15],y[15];
int i,j,m,n;
```
